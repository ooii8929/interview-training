# Code Training
## Support
We support javescript, python, and go language.

## Init
You need to deploy a python image and a js image of docker to run coding trainging.

```
cd server/util/code-training
docker build -t python-image -f python-dockerfile .
docker build -t node-image -f node-dockerfile .
```

After finished it, you can use the follow command to try if it's successful.

```
./build-python.sh
./build-javascript.sh
```

You don't need to build go language image, because it is compiling language which need its environment. 
So we use build-go.sh to run the go question.

```
cd server/env-build
./build.sh
```
